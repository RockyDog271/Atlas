Atlas, the helpful discord bot created by RockyDog271 and tested by my friends
it has functions such as:
- Admin commands such as Purge/Kick/Ban/etc
- AI powered conversation with GPT models
- AI powered roasts/jokes/etc intigration

and some more advanced ones like:
- Extensive help menu system inspired by Cisco(tm)
- Serveral rand options that include games and logic
- Flagging system inspired by UNIX CMD

And some future plans too!
- XP system
- Modlog/Userlog functionality
- Counting Channel
